# ButterCCM's Gba Emulator

The emulator used is iodine gba https://github.com/taisel/IodineGBA I did not make the emulator, I simply created a site with games to use with the emulator.

Any games with "WIP" in the name most likely won't work.

Roms are from personal dumps of roms and files shared among friends.
